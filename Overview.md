## Github[.com|.io]

Github(.com) is an implementation of the source (code) control manager git. github.com is to source code as google is to the search engine, and now there are many impl like gitlab or bitbucket. 

Since git(hub) is used by orgs, teams, open source projects, etc. there can be differing websites for users, groups, and (the most basic division) repositories. Doubtful you would need more than 1 site deployed, so the repo is named [username-i-made-for-you].github.ip

Thus, all (public) repos can be viewed from the web via github.com/[username]/[reponame] Fwiw, if there were multiple sites deployed it would be beneath landing site, like DeepInsDes.github.io/[different-repo-name]

Lets get into the details: https://github.com/DeepInsDes/DeepInsDes.github.io
