## CTS Classroom Control Quickstart Guides
These videos were commissioned by the Director of Classroom Technology Services at CU Denver/Anschutz and were deployed across 60-, 75- and 200- seat classrooms for use by the Faculty, Staff and Students on both campuses. They represent an analyzed need for quick, visually engaging, and user-focused video job-aids. Voice narration was specifically NOT included as other materials were made available for those with auditory or visual accessibility needs.

## Microlearning as Disruptive Education
This lesson examines the ways critical digital pedagogy (CDP) and microlearning interact, focusing on correlations, links, and how they can both inform and create disruptive educational practices. It was created using Articulate Rise, a popular web-based e-learning authoring tool designed for creating simple, responsive courses that are easy to use and accessible on various devices. It was designed to focus on ways that the current educational trend of microlearning could be used for, and viewed through the lens of, disruptive education.

## What is Microlearning? A Short Lesson
This course was created to provide new or unfamiliar learners with a short primer on the concept of microlearning. It was designed specifically with mobile platforms in mind, which is itself one main characteristic of microlearning. The short, gamified nature was also chosen intentionally to help the learner experience other main characteristics of a microlearning lesson.
