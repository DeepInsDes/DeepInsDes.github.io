This blog entry from an industry innovator and leader evaluates several AI tools from an ID perspective. It’s a valuable resource as well as an illuminating commentary on where AI might be taking our industry. I believe there must always be a place for the human touch in ID creation, and I think that this post helps to find ways we can, as Cathy says, adapt to using AI in our work, rather than getting run over by it. Better to be prepared for it than to get blindsided by it!
